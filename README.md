- 👀 I’m interested in Art and creative "stuff".
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about AI and Machine Learning, (emphasis on LEARNING, I don't know a lot)
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate, but if you think my input could be usefull I'm open to discussing my experience.
- 📫 How to reach me? I'm sure you can figure something out.
- 😄 Pronouns? I'm a blokey sort of chap, I dont really care what you call me as long as it's not late for lunch.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Theres a church in Twyford, Hampshire that rings it's bells every year on the 17th Oct incase someone gets lost in the fog.
